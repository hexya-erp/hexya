== Introduction

The contribution required for the project is mainly in regard to feature standardization. The set of targeted features are mostly to be as close as possible to Odoo framework.
This will enable the team to reliably port all Odoo features into this project while maintaining the system in a workable state. The architecture followed will also be similar to Odoo framework, however deviations from this
framework will be discussed in our developer channel (Refer design guidelines here [doc/design.adoc]).

== Coding standard

For the love of code, we will be following the (Google's coding standard for Golang [https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/]). This will enable the team make code decisions faster and without any friction.

== Git

=== Tags and commit messages
Tags will be used to prefix your commit messages. Tags should be one of the following:

. [FIX] for bug fixes: mostly used in stable version but also valid if you are fixing a recent bug in development version;
. [REF] for refactoring: when a feature is heavily rewritten;
. [ADD] for adding new modules;
. [REM] for removing resources: removing dead code, removing views, removing modules, â€¦;
. [REV] for reverting commits: if a commit causes issues or is not wanted reverting it is done using this tag;
. [MOV] for moving files: use git move and do not change content of moved file otherwise Git may lose track and history of the file; also used when moving code from one file to another;
. [REL] for release commits: new major or minor stable versions;
. [IMP] for improvements: most of the changes done in development version are incremental improvements not related to another tag;
. [MERGE] for merge commits: used in forward port of bug fixes and main commit for a number of commits;
. [I18N] for changes in translation files;
. [DOC] for changes in project or module documentations;
